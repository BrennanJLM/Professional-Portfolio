Professional portfolio challenge #02 for Module-02.  The purpose of this challenge was to create a portfolio webpage to showcase my talents as a web designer.  There were several pieces of criteria that needed to be met for completion of the challege, they include:
-presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them 
-completed and functional navigation links
-the completed first module (Run-Buddy) image is the largest
-clicking on images you will be taken to the deployed application
-when the screen is being resized, the screen will have a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
